# Format specifier
% is a place holder for the Variable.
Used to define and format the type of data to be displayed.

    %c  -charcter data types
    %d  -integer data types
    %s  -string(array of characters)
    %f  -floating points e.g numbers with a decimal part
    %lf -double data type.

To use string methods add these file in your program

    #include <string.h>

To use bool(True or false)into your program for checking condition add these file to your program

    #include <bool.h>

To perfom mathematical computation add these file to your program

    #include <math.h>

NOTE: C is not object oriented hence has no string data type.
